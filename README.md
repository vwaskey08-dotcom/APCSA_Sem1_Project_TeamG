K-pop Demon Hunters: Virtual Life Simulator

# Project Overview
The simulator is designed to enable the user to act as the manager of either Rumi, Mira, Zoey, or Jinu, allowing the player to dictate their behaviour to boost energy and popularity. The program acts as an extension of the movie, so when players are successful, they can save the Honmoon, but if they lose, the demons take over.

# Playable Characters:
-Rumi: Purple hair, can sing, and uses a sword

-Jinu: Black hair, can dance, and uses a lute

-Mira: Pink hair, can rap, and uses a 

-Zoey: Purple hair, can write songs, and uses a

# Main Classes:
The main classes are Rumi, Jinu, Mira, and Zoey, who are all under a K-pop interface, so they exhibit similar behaviours typical of a K-pop star. Each class is implemented within the main class to allow the player to choose different characters to manage and allow each character to have different attributes.

# How to Run the Program:
The program is run within the main class, requiring user input at every step, starting with choosing a character to play as, such as Rumi, by inputting a number, like 1. From there, the player will be able to dictate the actions of their character by inputting numbers, like 1 to make them sleep, and either save the honmoon or allow the demons to win.

# Development Process
We worked together as a team to complete the program, with each team member working on a different class and finishing a different part of the main program. We had daily scrum meetings, each utilzing our various roles within the team to make sure each part of the program was completed efficently with minimal conflict.
